# Incident-Response-Planning-and-Execution

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

This project focuses on designing and executing an Incident Response Plan (IRP) to effectively handle a cybersecurity incident from detection through to recovery. The goal is to build a comprehensive and actionable response strategy that helps organizations minimize the impact of incidents, mitigate risks, and improve overall security posture. The project involves creating a structured incident response plan, defining roles, testing the plan through simulated scenarios, and using a set of cybersecurity tools to automate and manage the response process.

- Firewall (pfSense) – For blocking malicious IPs or addresses involved in the attack, and controlling traffic during the incident.
- Ticketing System (Jira) – To track and manage incidents, ensuring they are properly logged, assigned, and resolved.
- Slack – For real-time team collaboration, communication, and incident alerts.
- Forensic Tools (Autopsy) – For conducting in-depth forensic analysis on compromised systems.
- Backup/Recovery Tools (Veeam) – For ensuring data integrity and recovery during an incident, especially after data corruption or ransomware attacks.


## Steps

1. Develop an Incident Response Plan (IRP)
Objective: Create a comprehensive and standardized incident response plan that outlines procedures for identifying, managing, and mitigating security incidents.

Steps:

Define Incident Categories: Classify incidents based on severity (e.g., low, medium, high) and type (e.g., malware, phishing, DDoS, insider threats).
Establish Roles & Responsibilities: Assign key roles to stakeholders (e.g., Incident Response Lead, IT Support, Legal, Communications) and define responsibilities for each role during an incident.
Define Communication Channels: Set up communication procedures with internal teams and external stakeholders (e.g., law enforcement, vendors).
Create Incident Handling Procedures: Develop procedures for identifying, analyzing, containing, and recovering from each type of incident.
Define Metrics for Incident Tracking: Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response time, time to containment, and recovery time.
Tools Implemented:

Jira (for tracking and managing incidents).
Slack (for communication).
Skills Acquired:

Incident response strategy development.
Risk assessment and classification of security incidents.
Role-based management and team coordination.

2. Implement Incident Detection and Monitoring
Objective: Establish a system to monitor and detect incidents in real-time using security monitoring tools.

Steps:

Set up SIEM (Splunk): Configure Splunk to collect and analyze logs from multiple sources (e.g., firewalls, servers, endpoints). Set up rules to detect suspicious activities (e.g., unusual login attempts, malware signatures).
Integrate Threat Intelligence (MISP): Integrate MISP with Splunk to pull threat intelligence feeds (e.g., known malicious IPs, domains, file hashes) to enhance detection capabilities.
Configure CrowdStrike: Install CrowdStrike on all endpoints to detect malware or any unusual behavior in real-time.
Enable Real-time Alerts: Set up alerts in Splunk to notify the team of any security anomalies, and use Slack for immediate incident notifications.
Tools Implemented:

Splunk (SIEM for event collection and analysis).
MISP (Threat intelligence).
CrowdStrike (EDR for endpoint detection).
Slack (for real-time alerts).
Skills Acquired:

SIEM configuration and rule creation.
Threat intelligence integration for enhanced detection.
Endpoint security and monitoring.

3. Incident Identification and Triage
Objective: Quickly identify and assess the severity of the security incident to prioritize actions.

Steps:

Incident Identification: When an alert is triggered in Splunk or CrowdStrike, the first step is to validate if it represents a true positive or a false positive.
Triage: Evaluate the scope and impact of the incident by collecting relevant data (e.g., logs, endpoint activity) to determine the affected systems, users, and data. Use Autopsy (forensic tool) to analyze compromised systems and gather evidence.
Categorize the Incident: Based on severity and type (e.g., ransomware, data breach), classify the incident into the appropriate category in Jira for tracking.
Tools Implemented:

Splunk (incident alerts and initial data analysis).
CrowdStrike (endpoint analysis and detection).
Autopsy (forensic analysis on compromised systems).
Jira (incident categorization and tracking).
Skills Acquired:

Incident validation and triage.
Forensic analysis and evidence gathering.
Incident categorization and prioritization.

4. Incident Containment and Mitigation
Objective: Limit the spread and impact of the incident while keeping critical systems operational.

Steps:

Network Isolation: Use pfSense to block malicious IP addresses, and contain the attack by isolating affected systems from the network.
Endpoint Quarantine: Use CrowdStrike to isolate infected endpoints, preventing malware from spreading further across the network.
Communication: Notify all relevant stakeholders (internal teams, management, external vendors) via Slack to inform them of the incident's status and actions taken.
Data Protection: Ensure that backups are intact and unaffected by the attack, using Veeam to verify the integrity of the backup and initiate recovery if necessary.
Tools Implemented:

pfSense (network isolation).
CrowdStrike (endpoint containment).
Slack (communication with stakeholders).
Veeam (backup integrity and recovery).
Skills Acquired:

Network and endpoint containment strategies.
Incident communication protocols.
Backup verification and recovery procedures.

5. Incident Eradication and Recovery
Objective: Remove the root cause of the incident and recover from the attack with minimal disruption.

Steps:

Root Cause Analysis: Analyze the compromised systems using CrowdStrike and Autopsy to determine how the attacker gained access and remove any remaining malware or vulnerabilities.
Patch Vulnerabilities: Apply security patches and updates to affected systems to prevent the incident from recurring.
System Restoration: Restore any lost or compromised data from backups using Veeam and ensure the systems are back online.
System Monitoring: Set up enhanced monitoring using Splunk to detect any potential re-infection or suspicious activity after recovery.
Tools Implemented:

CrowdStrike (malware removal and root cause analysis).
Autopsy (forensic analysis for attack vectors).
Veeam (data restoration and backup recovery).
Splunk (post-incident monitoring).
Skills Acquired:

Root cause analysis and remediation.
Patch management and system hardening.
Data restoration and recovery strategies.

6. Post-Incident Review and Reporting
Objective: Review the incident to identify lessons learned and improve future response efforts.

Steps:

Post-Mortem Analysis: Conduct a meeting with all stakeholders (security team, IT, legal, management) to review the incident response, identify what worked well, and areas for improvement.
Documentation: Document the incident timeline, response actions, lessons learned, and improvement recommendations in a detailed report.
Update IRP: Revise the Incident Response Plan (IRP) based on the findings, incorporating any lessons learned or missed steps.
Compliance Reporting: If applicable, ensure that the incident is reported to regulatory bodies or authorities (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA) based on the incident type.
Tools Implemented:

Jira (for incident tracking and post-mortem documentation).
Slack (for team communication during the review process).
Skills Acquired:

Post-incident analysis and reporting.
Continuous improvement of incident response processes.
Compliance and regulatory reporting.
